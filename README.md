<h1>Logistic Regression from Scratch</h1>
<p> This repository contains an implementation of logistic regression coded entirely from scratch, without the use of machine learning libraries like Scikit-learn or TensorFlow. The project demonstrates a hands-on approach to understanding the core mathematical concepts behind logistic regression, including:</p>
<ul> 
  <li> 
Sigmoid Function: Used to map predictions to probabilities.
    </li>
  <li> 
Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: The cost function for logistic regression.
    </li>
  <li> 
Gradient Descent: To optimize the model by updating weights based on the gradient of the loss function.
  </li>
  <li>
Model Training and Evaluation: Includes methods for training the model on labeled data and evaluating its accuracy.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Key Features:</h1>
<ul> 
  <li> 
Custom implementation of the logistic regression algorithm.
  </li>
  <li> 
Step-by-step gradient descent to minimize the cost function.
    </li>
  <li> 
Hyperparameter tuning for learning rate and number of epochs.
  </li>
</ul>
